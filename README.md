A Prescriber-Oriented Tool for Reimbursement Indications of Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors in Adult Solid Tumors in Belgium 

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment landscape for solid tumors. In Belgium, eleven ICIs currently hold reimbursement approval for adult patients. However, reimbursement conditions are published by RIZIV/INAMI per pharmaceutical specialty, not by cancer type, making it challenging for prescribers to quickly identify the most appropriate option for a given diagnosis. A diagnosis-driven approach could streamline treatment selection and improve clinical decision-making.
